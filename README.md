# Happy Planting Device 🌱 

A fun and practical Arduino project—a moisture-detecting plant buddy that makes noise(via MP3)🔊 and lights up💡 when it’s thirsty, drinking, or full. Perfect for learning embedded systems, sensors, and hardware-software integration.

## 💡 Features
- Capacitive moisture sensor input
- Moisture level mapped to LED brightness
- DFMini MP3 module with custom audio playback
- Custom 3D printed or laser-cut housing
- Expandable to support WiFi, Discord alerts, or real-time clock triggers

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Arduino Nano(Microcontroller)
- Capacitive Moisture Sensor
- DFPlayer Mini MP3

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Connect components as shown in schematic (coming soon)
2. Upload the code from `/code` folder to Arduino using Arduino IDE
3. Format SD card with `/mp3/0001.mp3`, `0002.mp3`, `0003.mp3`
4. Insert into MP3 module and power the board
5. Enjoy your screaming plant!

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Analog sensor reading and interpretation
- Breadboarding + voltage divider setup
- Serial communication (RX/TX) with external modules
- Modular, scalable hardware design
