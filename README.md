# Happy Planting Device ðŸŒ± 

A fun and practical Arduino projectâ€”a moisture-detecting plant buddy that says ' Sungyoung's Plant1 needs water!ðŸ’§' and lights upðŸ’¡ when itâ€™s thirsty. When you give the plant waterðŸš¿, it plays happy sounds (music)ðŸŽµ! 
Perfect for learning embedded systems, sensors, and hardware-software integration.


## Overview
The Happy Planting device is equipped with a moisture sensor and a customizable MP3 player, allowing your household plants to play a unique sound whenever they need water. This playful feature helps users track soil moisture levels and water their plants more reliably and intuitively.

## Integration
This project was developed using Arduino C and C++ for embedded systems. The codebase primarily utilizes C++, enhanced by Arduino-specific methods and libraries for handling sensors, serial communication, and audio playback. The combination of hardware and software showcases hands-on hardware-software integration and real-time sensor interaction.

- Programming Language: C/C++ 
- Arduino IDE
- Libraries:	DFRobotDFPlayerMini, SoftwareSerial
